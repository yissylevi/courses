This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(manipulate)
myPlot <- function(s) {
    plot(cars$dist - mean(cars$dist), cars$speed - mean(cars$speed))
    abline(0, s)
}

manipulate(myPlot(s), s = slider(0, 2, step = 0.1))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(rCharts)
require(datasets)e that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
